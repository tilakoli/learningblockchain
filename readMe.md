## What is BlockChain?==============>

-> Blockchain is basically a network of computers called nodes which all have same history
of the transaction made using this network. In other words a transactions made in blockchain
cannot be changed once they are created, making it the most secure form of transactions.

-> Currently, there are at least four types of blockchain networks — public blockchains, private blockchains, consortium blockchains and hybrid blockchains.

## Web 3.0 vs BlockChain ==============>

-> Simply put the three crucial foundations of Web 3.0 are Artficial Intelligence(AI), Internet of Things(IOT),
and blockchain technology.

-> Web 3.0 will be a big change because it will be a decentralized version of the whole internet where people will be able
to share money and information without the need for a middleman like a bank making the whole transaction more reliable, fast and secure. And that is where cryptocurrencies come in i.e for the transactions.

## How does a Decentralized app(DAPP) works ? ==============>

**\*\*\*** Taking Etherium as a blockchain network example **\*\*\***

=> etherium is like a giant network of computers where all the nodes agree on the same state of the data
throughout the network.

=> Where Ether is the cryptocurrency in this etherium network which is used to create transactions that change
the state of the data, when we broadcast a transaction we also offer up a small amount of Ether which provides incentive for another computer in the network to execute the transaction aka gas fee.

=> Normally when we build a web application we write some code then deploy it to a centralized server like aws
But for a decentralized app on blockchain our backend code is contained in a smart contract usually written in the solidity language which is just an application that lives on the blockchain that can govern the behaviour between multiple accounts.

=> A DAPP uses a normal ui code as a frontend except for the fact that user authentication works in a completely different way.

=> Unlike web 2.0 the end user owns all their data, as a developer this means that we no longer need to collect the username and password.

=> The user has a public wallet address that can recieve payments and private key that can sign transactions to send payments to someone else the user can connect their wallet to a browser plugin like metamask, and then the frontend app can interact with the users wallet to do somekind of transaction.

## What is a NFT?==============>

NFT = Non Fungible(not replacable by another identical item) Token

=> A non-fungible token(NFT) is a non-interchangeable unit of data stored on a blockchain, a form of digital ledger, that can be sold and traded. Types of NFT data units may be associated with digital files such as photos, videos, and audio.

=>A non-fungible token (NFT) is a unique digital asset that represents ownership of real-world items like art, video clips, music, and more. NFTs use the same blockchain technology that powers cryptocurrencies, but they're not a currency.

## How are NFTs unique in relation to cryptocurrencies? ===============>

=> Both NFTs and cryptocurrencies are based on blockchain, utilizing similar innovation and similar standards. Accordingly, they will quite often draw in similar players. NFTs can be considered a subset of the crypto culture, and you by and large need cryptographic forms of money to trade NFTs.

=> But the main difference is indicated in the name. Cryptocurrency is a currency. Like every other currency, it has only economic value and is fungible. That means that, within a particular cryptocurrency, it doesn’t matter which crypto token you have; it has the same value as the next one, 1 $ETH = 1 $ETH. But NFTs are non-fungible, and they have a value that goes way beyond economics.

=> Developers can create their own tokens in the form of smart contracts, In terms of code a NFT is just a number in a smart contract mapped to a wallet address.

## Non Fungible Token vs Fungible Tokens ================>

=> Images, gifs, etc's are the example of non Fungible tokes, while ether is an example of a fungible token.

## Smart Contracts

=>Smart contracts are simply programs stored on a blockchain that run when predetermined conditions are met. They typically are used to automate the execution of an agreement/transaction so that all participants can be immediately certain of the outcome, without any intermediary’s involvement or time loss.

=> An example of a language used to write smart contracts for a blockchain apps is Solidity, which has a similar syntax as JavaScript.

=> For testing smart contracts we can use various libraries like Waffle, Truffle(yes these are testing libraries) etc.

## IPFS (Interplanetary file system)

=>IPFS is a file sharing system that can be leveraged to more efficiently store and share large files. It relies on cryptographic hashes that can easily be stored on a blockchain.

=> IPFS is a peer-to-peer file system that provides a way to store and retrieve any kind of digital content, very similar to the way bitorrent works.

=>There are even databases built on top of IPFS like Thread DB, which is like a peer to peer version of mongo DB.
